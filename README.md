# Team 11 Final Project - Dynamico

## [Link to Dynamico](https://dynamico-swe.herokuapp.com/)
## Introduction
The Dynamico webpage uses a combination of components from Flask backend and React frontend in order to deliver a real-time project management web application. The purpose of this project is to replace the overwhelming number of individual applications that we as students currently use when we are tasked with a group project. These including Discord, Google Drive, and GitHub to name a few. As such, our aim was to incorporate all of the functionality that these applications offer into one concise space for easier access and cooperation between group members. Dynamico is a platform that allows group members to communicate with each other, share files with one another and schedule deadlines either on a calendar or through a to-do list.
